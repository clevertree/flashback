# Friends List Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

This document summarizes the implementation of the friends list feature as requested on October 31, 2025.

### 1. Removed ClientsListSection UI ✅
- **File Modified**: `client/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed import of `ClientsListSection`
  - Removed `<ClientsListSection>` component usage
  - Removed old `ClientInfo` interface definition from page.tsx

**Rationale**: We no longer list connected peers automatically. Instead, users maintain a friends list with specific email addresses.

---

### 2. Updated Data Types ✅
- **File Modified**: `client/src/apiTypes.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `publicCertificate?: string` field to `RegisterResultData` interface
  - Created new `ClientInfo` interface with friend-oriented fields:
    ```typescript
    export interface ClientInfo {
        email: string; // Required: Friend's email address
        ip?: string; // Socket IP address
        port?: number; // Socket port
        remote_ip?: string; // Remote IP if different from local
        local_ip?: string; // Local IP
        peer_status?: string; // Connection status
        publicCertificate?: string; // Public certificate for establishing handshake
    }
    ```

**Rationale**: `ClientInfo` now represents friend data rather than connected peer data. Email is the primary identifier, and socket/certificate info is populated on-demand via API lookup.

---

### 3. Created FriendsListSection Component ✅
- **File Created**: `client/src/components/FriendsListSection/FriendsListSection.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - **Hardcoded Default Friends**: `'ari@asu.edu'` and `'test@test.com'`
    - TODO comment added: "Remove hardcoded friend entries once user account search feature is implemented"
  - **Manual Entry**: Input field + "Add Friend" button to add new friends by email
  - **Friend Management**:
    - Display all friends in a list
    - "Visit" button for each friend (triggers API lookup)
    - "Remove" button to delete friends from the list
  - **Visit Functionality**:
    - Calls `window.flashbackApi.apiLookup(email)` to fetch latest socket info
    - Retrieves public certificate from server response
    - Creates `ClientInfo` object with socket data + certificate
    - Calls `onFriendVisit` callback to load RemoteHouse UI
  - **Error Handling**: Shows error messages for API failures
  - **Loading States**: Displays "Loading..." on visit button during API call
  - **Visibility**: Only shown after server registration

---

### 4. Updated Visit Flow ✅
**Previous Flow**:
- Server provided list of connected clients
- User clicked "Visit" on a connected client
- RemoteHouse loaded with IP/port

**New Flow**:
1. User maintains friends list with email addresses
2. User clicks "Visit" on a friend entry
3. App calls `apiLookup(email)` to server
4. Server returns:
   - Latest socket info (IP, port)
   - Public certificate for that user
5. App uses public certificate to establish handshake with remote client
6. RemoteHouse UI loads with socket info

**Key Changes**:
- Email-based lookup instead of listing all connected peers
- Public certificate included in lookup response
- Remote client uses private key (already has it) for handshake

---

### 5. API Response Updates ✅
- **RegisterResultData**: Now includes `publicCertificate?: string`
- **Lookup Response**: Expected to return:
  ```typescript
  {
    ip: string,
    port: number,
    publicCertificate: string, // or "certificate"
    // other fields...
  }
  ```

**Note**: Server-side implementation needs to:
1. Return public certificate in broadcast/register responses
2. Return public certificate in lookup responses
3. Store and retrieve certificates per user email

---

### 6. Health Check Deferred ✅
As requested, health checks for friends will be added in a later phase. Current implementation focuses on:
- Friend list management
- Email-based lookup
- Certificate exchange
- Basic connection establishment

---

## TODO Items for Later

1. **Remove Hardcoded Friends** (marked with TODO comment in code)
   - Add user account search feature
   - Allow discovering users by email/username search
   - Remove `DEFAULT_FRIENDS` constant

2. **Friend List Persistence**
   - Save friends list to config file
   - Load friends on app startup
   - Sync across sessions

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Add periodic health checks for friends
   - Display online/offline status indicators
   - Show last seen timestamps

4. **Server-Side Implementation**
   - Ensure `/api/lookup` returns public certificate
   - Ensure `/api/register` and `/api/broadcast` include certificate
   - Add certificate storage and retrieval logic

---

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `client/src/app/page.tsx` - Removed ClientsListSection, added FriendsListSection
2. ✅ `client/src/apiTypes.ts` - Updated interfaces for certificate and friend data
3. ✅ `client/src/components/FriendsListSection/FriendsListSection.tsx` - New component

## Files to Keep for Reference
- `client/src/components/ClientsListSection/` - Can be archived or removed (no longer used)
- Tests for ClientsListSection can be removed or archived

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Verify hardcoded friends appear on load
   - Test adding new friends by email
   - Test removing friends
   - Test "Visit" button triggers API lookup
   - Verify RemoteHouse loads with friend data

2. **API Integration Testing**:
   - Mock `window.flashbackApi.apiLookup()` to return test data
   - Verify certificate is extracted from response
   - Verify ClientInfo is properly constructed

3. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with API bridge unavailable
   - Test with invalid email format
   - Test with duplicate friend entries
   - Test with failed lookup (friend not found)

## Architecture Notes

### Before (Connected Peers Model)
```
Client → Server: "Get all connected clients"
Server → Client: [List of all online peers with IP/port]
Client: Display all peers, allow visit
```

### After (Friends List Model)
```
Client: Maintain friends list with emails
User clicks "Visit" on friend
Client → Server: "Lookup user by email"
Server → Client: {ip, port, publicCertificate} for that specific user
Client: Use certificate for handshake, load RemoteHouse
```

**Benefits**:
- Privacy: Don't broadcast all connected users
- Targeted: Only lookup friends you want to connect to
- Secure: Certificate exchange enables proper TLS/SSL handshake
- Scalable: No need to query all users, only specific lookups
