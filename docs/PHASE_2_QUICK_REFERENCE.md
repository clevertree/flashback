## The Three Things to Build

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Relay Tracker Backend (6-8 days)
**What:** 4 API endpoints + database  
**Where:** `/server/app/api/relay/`  
**How:**
- Register clients (store certificates) - NO AUTH
- Accept broadcast ready (mutual TLS) - port + addresses
- Lookup peers by email (mutual TLS)
- List all peers (mutual TLS)
- Auto-cleanup every 5 min (no heartbeat endpoint!)

**Key:** Mutual TLS, expiration management, cleanup job

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Peer Server + Certs (2 days)
**What:** Bind to all IPs, gather addresses, generate certs  
**Where:** `client/src-tauri/src/`  
**How:**
- Change bind: 127.0.0.1 ‚Üí 0.0.0.0
- Get local IPs (IPv4 + IPv6)
- Generate self-signed cert (ed25519)
- Store in ~/.dcc/certificates/

**Key:** Address gathering, certificate generation

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Client Integration (3.5-4 days)
**What:** Register, discover, browse peers  
**Where:** `client/src-tauri/src/` + `client/src/components/`  
**How:**
- Register with Relay on startup
- Broadcast ready (once) to Relay
- Query Relay for peers
- Try addresses in order (NAT traversal)
- Show peer status in UI

**Note:** Heartbeat is CLIENT-TO-CLIENT (Phase 2B), not to Relay

---

## 3 Critical Decisions ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Is Relay in Phase 2?** ‚Üí YES (recommended)
2. **Full Mutual TLS?** ‚Üí YES (recommended)
3. **When to start?** ‚Üí NOW (recommended)

## API Endpoints to Build

```
POST /api/relay/register
  Input: {certificate, email}
  Output: {client_id}
  Auth: None

POST /api/relay/broadcast/ready
  Input: {port, addresses, capabilities}
  Output: {broadcast_id, expires_in}
  Auth: Mutual TLS ‚úì

GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=user@example.com
  Input: Query parameter
  Output: {email, port, addresses}
  Auth: Mutual TLS ‚úì

GET /api/relay/broadcast/list
  Input: None
  Output: [{email, port, addresses}, ...]
  Auth: Mutual TLS ‚úì

NO HEARTBEAT ENDPOINT (client-to-client keepalive, Phase 2B+)
```

---

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Clients table
CREATE TABLE clients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  certificate TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Broadcasts table (expires in 1 hour)
CREATE TABLE broadcasts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  port INTEGER NOT NULL,
  addresses JSON NOT NULL,  -- ["192.168.1.50", "fd00::1"]
  capabilities JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,  -- NOW() + 3600 seconds
  last_heartbeat TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_broadcasts_email 
  ON broadcasts USING (client_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_broadcasts_expires 
  ON broadcasts (expires_at);
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Can't find peer | Relay not running | Start relay server |
| Mutual TLS fails | Wrong cert format | Use PEM format, ed25519 key |
| Address not reachable | Trying wrong order | Try local IPs first |
| Heartbeat missing | Timer not running | Check tokio spawn |
| Certificate expired | TTL too short | Set expires_at = now + 86400 |
| IPv6 not working | Link-local address | Skip fe80::/10 |
| Browser CORS fails | TLS from browser | Use Tauri bridge instead |

---

## Commands to Know

```bash
# Generate test certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365

# Test mutual TLS
curl --cert client.crt --key client.key \
  https://localhost:3000/api/relay/broadcast/ready

# Run tests
cargo test
npm test

# Check ports
lsof -i :3000   # Relay
lsof -i :54321  # Peer Server (varies)

# Kill background processes
pkill -f "node.*server"
pkill -f "tauri"
```
