# PHASE 2 REVISED: WHAT'S ACTUALLY NEEDED

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Context:** After clarifying Relay Tracker protocol, major gap identified  
**Impact:** Phase 2 scope significantly larger than initially thought

---

## The Realization

When we said "Phase 2 is complete," we meant:
- ✅ Peer Server file serving works
- ✅ RemoteHouse UI works  
- ✅ 55+ E2E tests pass

But **we never tested peer discovery**, because:
- ❌ Relay Tracker wasn't implemented
- ❌ Client certificate generation wasn't implemented
- ❌ Mutual TLS wasn't set up
- ❌ Address list handling wasn't done

**Result:** Two users running the app CAN'T find each other.

Phase 2 is actually three parallel work streams:

1. **Peer Server file serving** ✅ DONE
2. **Relay Tracker backend** ❌ NOT STARTED
3. **Client discovery integration** ❌ NOT STARTED

---

## Why This Matters

### What Works Now
```
User A:
  - Starts app
  - Generates certificate ❌ (not done)
  - HTTP server starts on random port ✅
  - Registers with relay ❌ (not done)
  - Broadcasts port + addresses ❌ (not done)

User B:
  - Starts app
  - Sees peer list ❌ (not done)
  - Tries to visit User A ❌ (no way to find them)
```

### What Needs to Happen
1. User A's client generates self-signed certificate with email embedded
2. User A registers certificate with Relay Tracker
3. User A broadcasts HTTP port + list of reachable IP addresses
4. User B queries Relay Tracker to find User A
5. User B tries User A's IP addresses in order (local first)
6. User B's browser connects to User A's Peer Server
7. User B browses User A's files

**Without 1-7 working, peer discovery fails.**

## The Three Work Streams

### Work Stream 1: Relay Tracker Backend (2-3 weeks)

**What needs to exist:**
- `POST /api/relay/register` - Client registration (certificate + email)
- `POST /api/relay/broadcast/ready` - Send port + addresses
- `GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup` - Find peer by email
- `GET /api/relay/broadcast/list` - List all online peers
- `POST /api/relay/broadcast/heartbeat` - Keep broadcast alive

**Why it's critical:**
- Without relay, peers can't find each other
- No other way to enable discovery in Phase 2
- Phase 3 depends on it

**Technology:**
- Next.js backend (already exists in `/server`)
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storage
- Node.js TLS support for mutual TLS

**Estimated effort:** 6-10 days

---

### Work Stream 2: Peer Server Enhancements (1-2 days)

**What needs to change:**
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1` (public IP)
- Get local IP addresses (v4 + v6)
- Send address list to UI

**Why it's critical:**
- Peer Server needs to be reachable from other machines
- Relay needs to know what addresses are available
- Client needs to try local addresses first (NAT traversal)

**Technology:**
- Rust networking libraries
- Axum HTTP server (already exists)

**Estimated effort:** 2 days

---

### Work Stream 3: Client Integration (3-4 weeks)

**What needs to happen:**
- Generate self-signed certificate on first run
- Register with Relay on startup
- Send address list to Relay
- Keep-alive heartbeat every 30 minutes
- Query Relay for peer list in RemoteHouse
- Try peer addresses in order
- Show connection status in UI

**Why it's critical:**
- Without cert generation, can't authenticate with Relay
- Without registration, peers won't show up in Relay
- Without heartbeat, broadcast expires after 1 hour
- Without address try-order, NAT traversal fails

**Technology:**
- Tauri commands (certificate generation, relay queries)
- React components (peer list, status indicators)
- Mutual TLS client

**Estimated effort:** 3.5-4 days per component = 7-8 days total

## Three Critical Decisions

### Decision 1: When to Implement Relay?

**Option A: Relay is part of Phase 2** (Recommended)
- Pro: Phase 2 is complete end-to-end
- Pro: Users can actually use the app
- Con: Phase 2 becomes 3-5 weeks instead of "done"
- Timeline: Start immediately, finish in 3-5 weeks

**Option B: Relay is Phase 2.5 or Phase 3**
- Pro: Phase 2 stays "done" for file serving
- Con: App is non-functional without Relay
- Con: Creates artificial phase boundary
- Timeline: Pushes Relay to next sprint

**Recommendation:** Option A - Relay must be in Phase 2 for functional end-to-end flow

---

### Decision 2: Mutual TLS or Simpler Auth?

Your protocol specifies mutual TLS for `/broadcast/ready` and `/broadcast/lookup`. Three options:

**Option A: Full Mutual TLS** (Recommended, your spec)
- Pro: Self-contained authentication (cert is identity)
- Pro: No separate password/token system needed
- Pro: Very secure
- Con: More complex to implement
- Effort: +2-3 days

**Option B: Simplified Auth** (Certificates for ID, simpler auth for API)
- Pro: Easier to implement initially
- Pro: Can add mutual TLS later
- Con: Needs temporary auth token system
- Con: Certificate doesn't authenticate API calls
- Effort: +1 day

**Option C: No Auth for now** (Relay runs locally only)
- Pro: Fastest to implement
- Con: Not suitable for production
- Con: Anyone on local network can query
- Effort: 0 days (but less secure)

**Recommendation:** Option A - Your mutual TLS spec is solid. Takes longer but is correct.

---

### Decision 3: Should RemoteHouse Browser Do Mutual TLS?

**Problem:** Browser can't do mutual TLS (security sandbox).

**Solution:** Use Tauri bridge.
- User in RemoteHouse clicks on peer
- React calls Tauri command: `query_relay_peers()`
- Tauri backend queries relay with mutual TLS
- Tauri returns peer list to React
- React shows list
- User clicks on peer
- React calls Tauri command: `connect_to_peer()`
- Tauri backend tries address list
- Tauri returns reachable address
- React browser connects directly to Peer Server

**This works great.** Adds ~1 day for Tauri command implementations.

## What Happens if We Skip Relay?

### Current State (Without Relay)
```
User A (192.168.1.50) starts app:
  - HTTP server on port 54321 ✓
  - Can access at: http://192.168.1.50:54321/api/files ✓

User B (192.168.1.100) wants to find User A:
  - Looks at peer list: ??? 
  - How does User B know about User A?
  - RemoteHouse shows: no peers available
```

**Result:** Non-functional peer discovery

### With Relay
```
User A starts app:
  - HTTP server on port 54321 ✓
  - Registers with Relay ✓
  - Broadcasts: port=54321, addresses=[192.168.1.50, ...] ✓

User B starts app:
  - Queries Relay: who's online? ✓
  - Relay responds: User A at addresses=[192.168.1.50, ...] ✓
  - User B tries 192.168.1.50:54321 ✓
  - User B connects and browses files ✓
```

**Result:** Functional end-to-end peer discovery

## What Phase 3 Adds (On Top of Phase 2)

Phase 3 (Friends List) assumes Phase 2 works perfectly. It adds:

1. **Local Friends Storage**
   - Store friends list locally (User A, User B, User C)
   - Persist across app restarts

2. **Health Checks**
   - Every 60 seconds, check if friend's peer server is reachable
   - Call `/api/health` endpoint on friend's Peer Server

3. **Fallback to Relay**
   - If direct health check fails, query Relay
   - Use Relay to find friend's new address

4. **Socket Caching**
   - Remember which address worked last time
   - Try that address first

5. **Status Indicators**
   - Online (health check succeeded)
   - Offline (no response from health checks)
   - Checking (currently trying)
   - Unknown (error)

**Phase 3 depends completely on Phase 2 discovery working.**

## What This Means for You

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Decide: Is Relay part of Phase 2? (Recommend: YES)
2. Decide: Which auth option? (Recommend: Full mutual TLS)
3. Decide: Start Relay development now? (If yes → start tomorrow)

### If You Say YES
- Phase 2 takes 4-5 weeks
- You'll have a fully functional peer discovery system
- Phase 3 becomes simpler (friends list on top of working discovery)
- Phase 4 (P2P discovery) is optional future enhancement

### If You Say NO (Relay is later)
- Phase 2 stays "done" (but non-functional)
- Phase 2.5 or Phase 3 becomes "implement Relay"
- Creates phase confusion
- Better to integrate Relay into Phase 2

## Why I'm Flagging This

**Your protocol specification is excellent.** It covers:
- ✅ Self-signed certificates
- ✅ Mutual TLS authentication
- ✅ Address list handling
- ✅ NAT traversal strategy
- ✅ Heartbeat keep-alive
- ✅ Expiration management

**But the implementation roadmap was missing.** You had:
- ✅ Peer Server code (done)
- ❌ Relay Tracker code (not started)
- ❌ Client certificate integration (not started)
- ❌ Discovery plumbing (not started)

**Result:** Architecture was clear, but execution path was unclear.

Now we have:
- ✅ Protocol specification (RELAY_TRACKER_PROTOCOL.md)
- ✅ Implementation roadmap (PHASE_2_RELAY_TRACKER_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- ✅ Detailed checklist (PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
- ✅ This clarification (PHASE_2_REVISED_WHAT_IS_NEEDED.md)

**Ready to build.**

## Questions for You

1. **Phase 2 Scope:** Should Relay Tracker be part of Phase 2, or separate?

2. **Mutual TLS:** Is the mutual TLS strategy correct, or should we simplify?

3. **Start Date:** When would you like to begin Relay Tracker development?

4. **Browser Concerns:** Are you concerned about RemoteHouse being a browser (TLS limitation)?

5. **Testing:** Should Relay and clients be tested together end-to-end in Phase 2?
