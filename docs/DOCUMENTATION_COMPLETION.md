PEER SERVER (Decentralized)
├─ Tech: Rust/Axum in Tauri
├─ Location: client/src-tauri/src/http_server.rs

## Final Note

The distinction between Relay Tracker and Peer Server is now crystal clear:

**Relay Tracker** = Centralized metadata coordinator (like BitTorrent tracker)
**Peer Server** = Decentralized content provider (like BitTorrent peer)

Together, they create a private, scalable, decentralized file sharing system.

The documentation explains how, why, and when to use each component.
