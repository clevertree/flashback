# Flashback Protocol Specification

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** üîê Security & Network Protocol Definition  
**Author's Input:** User clarification on Relay Tracker and network protocols

---

## Overview

Flashback uses a **certificate-based authentication model** with a **centralized Relay Tracker** for peer discovery and a **decentralized Peer Server** for file sharing.

---

## Part 1: Relay Tracker Protocol

### Client Registration

**Method:** Self-signed certificate with email embedded

```
Client generates:
  1. Private key (ed25519 or similar)
  2. Self-signed certificate containing:
     - Subject: CN=<email>@flashback or similar
     - Public key
  3. Stores certificate locally for future use

Client sends to Relay Tracker:
  POST /api/relay/register
  Body: {
    "certificate": "<PEM-encoded self-signed cert>",
    "email": "<email@domain.com>"
  }

Relay Tracker validates:
  ‚úì Certificate is valid
  ‚úì Email matches certificate CN
  ‚úì Email does not already exist in database
  ‚úì Certificate not previously registered

Relay Tracker stores:
  ‚Ä¢ Certificate (public key)
  ‚Ä¢ Email (unique identifier)
  ‚Ä¢ Registration timestamp
  ‚Ä¢ Client capabilities/metadata

Client response:
  - Success: 200 OK
  - Email exists: 409 Conflict (user must use different email or reset feature)
  - Invalid cert: 400 Bad Request
```

**Key Points:**
- Self-signed certificates eliminate need for CA infrastructure
- Email is **unique** per certificate
- One certificate = one email = one identity
- Future: Email verification + reset feature can replace certificate

---

### Client Authentication for API Calls

**Two API endpoints need authentication:**
1. `broadcast/ready` - Client announces it's online with port + IPs
2. `broadcast/lookup` - Client queries relay for other online peers

**Authentication Strategy: Mutual TLS with Signature Verification**

#### Option A: Mutual TLS (Recommended for simplicity)
```
Client establishes TLS connection to Relay:
  1. Client presents self-signed certificate (from registration)
  2. Relay verifies certificate matches registered certificate
  3. Relay extracts email from certificate CN
  4. TLS handshake completes - connection authenticated

All subsequent API calls on this connection:
  - Are authenticated by the TLS session
  - Relay knows email of caller
  - No additional auth headers needed
```

**Implementation:**
- Relay: Accept client certificates in TLS
- Relay: Map certificate to email in session
- Client: Send certificate + private key for mutual TLS

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No tokens or cookies needed
- ‚úÖ TLS built into all modern clients
- ‚úÖ Works with existing HTTP stacks
- ‚úÖ No session state needed beyond TLS

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires client-side certificate handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not all HTTP clients support mutual TLS easily

---

### **Recommendation: Option A (Mutual TLS)**

For `broadcast/ready` and `broadcast/lookup` APIs, use **Mutual TLS** because:
1. ‚úÖ Simple to implement (TLS built into HTTP clients)
2. ‚úÖ Stateless (no tokens to manage)
3. ‚úÖ Secure by default
4. ‚úÖ Email extraction from certificate
5. ‚úÖ Eliminates token management complexity

---

## What is Mutual TLS? (Deep Dive)

### Regular TLS (HTTPS)
```
Client connects to server:
  1. Client: "Hi server, prove who you are"
  2. Server: "Here's my certificate" (public key + identity)
  3. Client: Verifies certificate is trusted
  4. Client: Sends secret data encrypted with server's public key
  5. Connection established ‚úì

Result: Only server is authenticated
         Client is anonymous
```

**Example:** When you visit `https://example.com`, the browser verifies the server's certificate but the server doesn't verify you are who you claim to be.

---

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)
```
Client connects to server:
  1. Client: "Hi server, I'll prove who I am too"
  2. Client sends: "Here's MY certificate" (public key + identity)
  3. Server: "Verified, I trust you"
  4. Server sends: "Here's MY certificate" (public key + identity)
  5. Client: "Verified, I trust you"
  6. Connection established ‚úì

Result: BOTH client AND server are authenticated
        Both prove identity cryptographically
```

**Key difference:** The server (Relay Tracker) asks for and verifies the client's certificate before allowing the connection.

---

### How Mutual TLS Works for Relay Tracker

```
Phase 1: Client Registration (no auth)
  POST /api/relay/register
  Body: {
    "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
  ‚Üí Server stores certificate in database
  ‚Üí Server returns 200 OK

Phase 2: Client Wants to Query Relay (with mutual TLS)
  GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=peer@example.com

  Step A: TLS Handshake (mutual)
    Client: "Here's my certificate (from registration)"
    Server: "Verified! I found it in database"
    Connection is now authenticated
    
  Step B: HTTP Request
    GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=peer@example.com
    (Server already knows who sent this because TLS authenticated the client)
    
  Step C: Server Processes
    Server extracts email from client certificate: "user@example.com"
    Server queries database: "Find peer@example.com"
    Server returns peer details (port + addresses)
    
Result: No tokens needed, no auth headers needed
        TLS session proves client identity
```

---

### Code Example: Node.js Mutual TLS

**Setting up the server (Relay Tracker):**
```typescript
import https from 'https';
import fs from 'fs';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/server.key'),       // Server's private key
  cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/server.crt'),      // Server's certificate
  requestCert: true,                                   // Ask client for certificate
  rejectUnauthorized: false,                           // Accept all (validate in app)
  ca: []                                               // Optional: list of trusted CAs
};

// Create HTTPS server with mutual TLS
const server = https.createServer(options, app);

app.post('/api/relay/broadcast/ready', (req, res) => {
  // Extract client certificate from TLS handshake
  const clientCert = req.socket.getPeerCertificate();
  
  if (!clientCert || clientCert.subject.CN) {
    return res.status(401).json({error: "No client certificate"});
  }
  
  // Extract email from certificate CN (Common Name)
  const email = clientCert.subject.CN;  // e.g., "user@example.com"
  
  // Verify certificate is registered in database
  const registeredCert = db.query(
    "SELECT * FROM clients WHERE email = $1",
    [email]
  );
  
  if (!registeredCert || registeredCert.certificate !== clientCert.raw) {
    return res.status(401).json({error: "Certificate not registered"});
  }
  
  // ‚úÖ Certificate is valid and registered
  // Process the broadcast request
  const {port, addresses} = req.body;
  
  // Insert broadcast
  db.query(
    "INSERT INTO broadcasts (...) VALUES (...)",
    [email, port, addresses]
  );
  
  return res.json({status: "ok", broadcast_id: "..."});
});

server.listen(3000);
```

**Client side (using curl with certificates):**
```bash
# Register (no cert required)
curl -X POST https://localhost:3000/api/relay/register \
  --cacert server.crt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "certificate": "<PEM cert from earlier>"
  }'

# Query relay (WITH client cert - mutual TLS)
curl -X GET \
  https://localhost:3000/api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=peer@example.com \
  --cacert server.crt \                    # Trust server's certificate
  --cert client.crt \                      # Send my certificate
  --key client.key                         # Sign with my private key
```

**What happens:**
1. curl sends client certificate (--cert) and key (--key)
2. Server verifies the certificate is registered
3. Server extracts email from certificate CN
4. Server processes the request as authenticated
5. Response is returned

---

#### Option B: JWT Tokens (Alternative)
```
1. During TLS handshake (mutual TLS):
   Client authenticates with certificate
   Relay creates JWT token containing email

2. Client stores JWT token
3. All subsequent API calls include token:
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

Relay validates token before processing request
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Better mobile compatibility
- ‚úÖ Simpler for HTTP clients
- ‚úÖ Can add token expiration

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need session/token storage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Token expiration management

---

#### Option C: Message Signing (Highest Security)
```
Client signs each API request:
  1. Create request body
  2. Sign body with private key
  3. Send request + signature in header:
     Headers: X-Signature: <base64-signature>

Relay validates:
  1. Extract email from URL/body
  2. Fetch client certificate from database
  3. Verify signature matches certificate public key
  4. Accept if valid
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works with regular TLS (no mutual TLS)
- ‚úÖ Per-request authentication (no session state)
- ‚úÖ Prevents MITM attacks
- ‚úÖ Works with HTTP/2, HTTP/3

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex client implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance overhead (signature verification)

  }
]
```

## Important: Heartbeat is CLIENT-TO-CLIENT, NOT Relay

**‚ùå DO NOT build:** `POST /api/relay/broadcast/heartbeat` endpoint

**‚úÖ WHY:** 
- Heartbeat happens between peer clients (P2P keepalive)
- NOT to the Relay Tracker
- Relay uses TTL expiration instead (1 hour, auto-cleanup)

**How broadcasts stay alive:**
```
Client A wants to stay discoverable:
  1. Connects to Relay ‚Üí broadcasts port + addresses
  2. Relay stores broadcast with expires_at = NOW() + 1 hour
  3. If Client A goes offline ‚Üí broadcast expires naturally
  4. Cleanup job deletes expired broadcasts every 5 minutes

Direct peer heartbeat (Phase 2B):
  - Client A ‚Üî Client B exchange keepalives
  - NOT sent to Relay Tracker
  - Implemented in Peer Server HTTP endpoints
```

---

## Part 5: Network Architecture
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

---

## Part 3: Peer Server (Peer-to-Peer)

### Connection Protocol

**Step 1: Client A Registers with Relay**
```
Client A:
  - Opens ephemeral port (OS-chosen)
  - Registers port + address list with relay via broadcast/ready
  - Relay stores: (ClientA, port, addresses, timestamp)
```

**Step 2: Client B Wants to Connect to Client A**
```
Client B:
  - Queries relay: "Find ClientA@example.com"
  - Relay responds: {port: 54321, addresses: [...]}
```

**Step 3: Client B Connects to Client A**
```
Client B tries addresses in order:
  1. 192.168.1.50:54321 (local network first)
  2. 10.0.0.5:54321 (private IP second)
  3. 2001:db8::1:54321 (IPv6)
  4. 203.0.113.42:54321 (public WAN IP last)

Connection flow:
  ‚úì Client B connects to ClientA's Peer Server
  ‚úì No authentication required (localhost trust model)
  ‚úì Client B accesses /api/files, /content/*, /download/*
  ‚úì Files served from ClientA's fileRootDirectory
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ Clients provide **multiple IPs** (local + remote)
- ‚úÖ Clients try IPs in order (local first = better performance)
- ‚úÖ Relay stores address list at time of broadcast
- ‚úÖ No authentication on Peer Server (for now)
- ‚úÖ Future: Add authentication when needed

---

## Part 4: Peer Server HTTP API

### No Authentication Required (For Now)

```
GET /api/files
  ‚Üí List files in root

GET /api/files/{path}
  ‚Üí List files in subdirectory

GET /content/{file}
  ‚Üí Get text file content

GET /download/{file}
  ‚Üí Stream/download binary file

GET /health (NEW)
  ‚Üí Health check for Phase 3
  Response: { status: "ok", email: "user@example.com" }
```

**Future Authentication (TBD):**
- Planned for later phase
- Could be token-based or certificate-based
- Not needed for initial deployment

---

## Part 5: Network Architecture

### Address List Handling

**Client must provide:**
```
addresses: [
  "192.168.1.50",           // Local network (v4)
  "fd00::1",                // Local network (v6)
  "203.0.113.42",           // Public WAN (optional)
  "vpn.example.com"         // DNS hostname (future)
]
```

**Relay stores address list at broadcast time**

**Connecting client tries in order:**
```
for address in relay_response.addresses:
  try:
    connect(address, port, timeout=5s)
    if success:
      return connection
  except:
    continue
  
if no connection:
  fail("Peer unavailable")
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works behind NAT (tries local first)
- ‚úÖ Works across networks (tries public IP)
- ‚úÖ Supports IPv4 and IPv6
- ‚úÖ Handles network changes gracefully

---

## Part 6: Certificate & Authentication Summary

### Registration Flow (No Auth)
```
Client: Register(certificate, email) ‚Üí Success
Relay: Store certificate, email ‚Üí Ready
```

### Broadcast Ready (Auth: Mutual TLS)
```
Client: POST /broadcast/ready with cert ‚Üí TLS authenticated
Relay: Extract email from cert ‚Üí Accept or reject
```

### Broadcast Lookup (Auth: Mutual TLS)
```
Client: GET /broadcast/lookup?email=X with cert ‚Üí TLS authenticated
Relay: Extract email from cert ‚Üí Return peer addresses
```

### Peer File Access (No Auth)
```
Client B: GET http://peer-ip:port/api/files ‚Üí No auth needed
Peer: Serve files from fileRootDirectory
```

---

## Part 7: Phase Implications

### Phase 2: Requires Relay Tracker Implementation ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Client registration endpoint
- ‚úÖ Broadcast ready endpoint (mutual TLS)
- ‚úÖ Broadcast lookup endpoint (mutual TLS)
- ‚úÖ List peers endpoint
- ‚úÖ Certificate storage
- ‚úÖ Background cleanup (expiration)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NO heartbeat endpoint (heartbeat is client-to-client)

**Phase 2 is NOT complete without Relay Tracker** - it's a prerequisite for clients to find each other.

### Phase 3: Friends List & Health Checks
- ‚úÖ Adds local friends storage
- ‚úÖ Periodic health checks (ping /health endpoint)
- ‚úÖ Relay fallback when cached socket fails
- ‚úÖ Health check timeout + retry logic

### Phase 4+: Future Features
- Email verification + reset feature
- Peer Server authentication
- P2P discovery (Kademlia, mDNS, gossip protocols)
- Advanced NAT traversal

---

## Part 8: What Was Confusing in My Understanding

### ‚ùå Error 1: Phase 2 Was Standalone
- **My understanding:** Phase 2 file sharing could work without Relay Tracker
- **Reality:** Phase 2 REQUIRES Relay Tracker for peer discovery
- **Fix:** Relay Tracker must be implemented in Phase 2, not Phase 3

### ‚ùå Error 2: Localhost-Only Binding
- **My understanding:** Peer Server only listens on 127.0.0.1
- **Reality:** Peer Server listens on **all addresses** (0.0.0.0), and clients report address list to relay
- **Fix:** Refactor Peer Server to accept list of addresses (v4 + v6)

### ‚ùå Error 3: Socket Discovery
- **My understanding:** Unclear how relay gets the peer's socket
- **Reality:** Client explicitly sends address list + port via `/broadcast/ready`
- **Fix:** This is now clear

### ‚ùå Error 4: Authentication Complexity
- **My understanding:** Email spoofing, no clear auth flow
- **Reality:** Certificates eliminate email spoofing, mutual TLS handles auth
- **Fix:** Clear authentication strategy established

### ‚ùå Error 5: "Relay Status" Endpoint
- **My understanding:** Not clear what this is
- **Reality:** You said you're not sure either - **should we remove it or clarify it?**

### ‚ùå Error 6: Future P2P Discovery
- **My understanding:** Should be designed now
- **Reality:** Explicitly planned for future phase (not Phase 2 or 3)
- **Fix:** Phase 2 and 3 use Relay Tracker only

---

## Part 9: Action Items

### Document Updates Needed
1. Create `RELAY_TRACKER_PROTOCOL.md` (new comprehensive protocol doc)
2. Create `CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION.md` (certificate + mutual TLS auth)
3. Create `NETWORK_ADDRESSING.md` (address list handling)
4. Update `PHASE_2_RELAY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (Relay Tracker is Phase 2 prerequisite)
5. Update `SERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md` (address list, not single socket)
6. Remove or clarify "Relay Status" endpoint

### Implementation Priorities for Phase 2
1. **Relay Tracker Implementation** (backend)
   - [ ] Client registration endpoint
   - [ ] Certificate storage
   - [ ] Broadcast ready (mutual TLS)
   - [ ] Broadcast lookup (mutual TLS)
   - [ ] List peers endpoint
   - [ ] Broadcast expiration + cleanup

2. **Client Updates** (Rust/Tauri)
   - [ ] Generate self-signed certificate
   - [ ] Store certificate locally
   - [ ] Register with relay on startup
   - [ ] Gather local + remote addresses
   - [ ] Send address list to relay
   - [ ] Query relay for peers

3. **RemoteHouse Updates** (React)
   - [ ] Query relay to get peer list
   - [ ] Try addresses in order (local first)
   - [ ] Fall back to next address on failure
   - [ ] Show peer availability status

**Note:** Heartbeat is implemented later (Phase 2B) as peer-to-peer keepalive, NOT in Relay Tracker.

---

## Part 10: Security Considerations

### Certificate Security
- ‚úÖ Self-signed eliminates CA compromise risk
- ‚úÖ Email embedded in certificate (immutable)
- ‚úÖ Private key stored locally (client controls)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Future: Email verification for reset feature

### Mutual TLS Security
- ‚úÖ Prevents certificate spoofing
- ‚úÖ Server validates client certificate
- ‚úÖ No tokens to leak or intercept
- ‚úÖ Standard TLS security

### Peer Server Security
- ‚úÖ localhost trust model (for now)
- ‚úÖ User controls fileRootDirectory
- ‚úÖ Directory traversal prevention
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Future: Authentication when needed

### Network Security
- ‚úÖ Relay doesn't see file transfers
- ‚úÖ Direct P2P connections (no proxy)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS for relay (TLS)
- ‚úÖ Multiple IPs prevent single point of failure

---

## Summary

**Your protocol is well-designed:**
- ‚úÖ Certificate-based identity (no usernames/passwords)
- ‚úÖ Mutual TLS for API authentication
- ‚úÖ Multiple address support for NAT traversal
- ‚úÖ Ephemeral port strategy
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: Relay (discovery) vs Peer (files)

**Key clarifications:**
- üîê Phase 2 REQUIRES Relay Tracker
- üìç Peer Server listens on all IPs (not just localhost)
- üîë Mutual TLS recommended for `/broadcast/ready` and `/broadcast/lookup`
- üåê Address list enables NAT traversal
- üìå P2P discovery (Kademlia, mDNS) is Phase 4+

**Next Steps:**
1. Clarify: Should we keep or remove "Relay Status" endpoint?
2. Document: Full relay tracker protocol specification
3. Implement: Relay Tracker as Phase 2 prerequisite
4. Update: Client code to register with relay

---

**Questions:**
1. Should `/api/relay/status` be removed or kept for future monitoring?
2. Should we document the mutual TLS implementation details now, or save for later?
3. Should Phase 2 include Relay Tracker implementation, or is it split across phases?
