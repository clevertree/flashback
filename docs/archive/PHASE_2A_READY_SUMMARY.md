# 🎯 Phase 2A Ready - Critical Corrections Applied

**Date:** October 30, 2025 Evening  
**Status:** ✅ ALL CLARIFICATIONS APPLIED  
**Git:** Committed and pushed (a8c985e)

---

## What Just Happened

Three critical corrections were made to all documentation **before Phase 2A begins Monday**:

### 1️⃣ PostgreSQL Already Set Up ✅
- **Old assumption:** Need to set up PostgreSQL on Day 1
- **New fact:** PostgreSQL already running
- **Action:** Skip setup, verify connection on Day 1 only
- **Implication:** Save ~2 hours on Monday

### 2️⃣ Heartbeat is Client-to-Client Only ❌
- **Old mistake:** 5 API endpoints including POST `/api/relay/broadcast/heartbeat`
- **New reality:** Heartbeat is peer-to-peer, NOT to Relay (Phase 2B+)
- **Solution:** Use TTL-based expiration + background cleanup instead
- **Result:** 4 endpoints (not 5), 6-8 days (same duration, reorganized)

### 3️⃣ Mutual TLS Fully Explained 🔐
- **Old:** Brief mention of mutual TLS
- **New:** Comprehensive explanation with Node.js code examples
- **Includes:** How it works, why it's needed, client/server examples
- **Ready:** To implement with confidence Monday

## The 4 Endpoints (Phase 2A)

```
API ENDPOINT SPECIFICATION

1. POST /api/relay/register
   No authentication
   Input: {certificate, email}
   Output: {client_id}
   Purpose: Initial client registration

2. POST /api/relay/broadcast/ready
   Mutual TLS required ✓
   Input: {port, addresses, capabilities}
   Output: {broadcast_id, expires_in}
   Purpose: Announce "I'm online"

3. GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=...
   Mutual TLS required ✓
   Input: email query parameter
   Output: {email, port, addresses}
   Purpose: Find peer by email

4. GET /api/relay/broadcast/list
   Mutual TLS required ✓
   Input: none
   Output: [{email, port, addresses}, ...]
   Purpose: List all online peers

NO HEARTBEAT ENDPOINT ✓
   Replaced by: TTL expiration + background cleanup
   When: Added in Phase 2B as client-to-client keepalive
```

## Timeline (Updated)

### Old Timeline (5 endpoints)
```
Day 1: Database setup
Day 2: Register endpoint
Day 3: Broadcast ready
Day 4: Broadcast lookup
Day 5: List + Heartbeat  ← REMOVED
Day 6: Cleanup + TLS
Day 7-8: Testing
```

### New Timeline (4 endpoints)
```
Day 1: Database setup (just verify, PostgreSQL done)
Day 2: Register endpoint
Day 3: Broadcast ready (mutual TLS)
Day 4: Broadcast lookup (mutual TLS)
Day 5: List endpoint (mutual TLS)
Day 6: Cleanup + TLS setup
Day 7-8: Testing + integration
```

**Duration:** Same 6-8 days, better organized ✓

## Mutual TLS - Quick Reference

### What It Is
```
Regular TLS:      Server proves identity    (one-way)
Mutual TLS:       Both prove identity       (two-way)
```

### How It Works for Relay Tracker
```
1. Client registers certificate
   POST /api/relay/register
   Server stores cert in database

2. Client makes authenticated request
   GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup
   TLS handshake:
     - Client presents cert
     - Server verifies cert in database
     - Connection authenticated ✓
   
3. Server processes as authenticated
   Extracts email from certificate CN
   Executes query as that user
```

### Code (Node.js Server)
```javascript
// Server setup
const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server.crt'),
  requestCert: true,                 // Ask client for cert
  rejectUnauthorized: false          // Accept all (validate in app)
};

https.createServer(options, app).listen(3000);

// In endpoint handler
app.get('/api/relay/broadcast/lookup', (req, res) => {
  // Extract client certificate from TLS
  const clientCert = req.socket.getPeerCertificate();
  const email = clientCert.subject.CN;  // "user@example.com"
  
  // Verify in database
  const registered = db.query("SELECT * FROM clients WHERE email = $1", [email]);
  if (!registered) return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized");
  
  // Process as authenticated request
  const peer = db.query("SELECT * FROM broadcasts WHERE client_id = ...");
  res.json(peer);
});
```

### Code (Client with curl)
```bash
# Register (no cert)
curl -X POST https://localhost:3000/api/relay/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","certificate":"<PEM>"}'

# Query (WITH mutual TLS)
curl -X GET https://localhost:3000/api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=peer@example.com \
  --cert client.crt \      # Send my cert
  --key client.key \       # Sign with my key
  --cacert server.crt      # Trust server cert
```

## Expiration Model (No Heartbeat Needed)

```
Timeline of a broadcast:

T=0:00    Client A comes online
          → Sends broadcast_ready to Relay
          → Relay stores: expires_at = NOW() + 3600 seconds

T=0:15    Client B queries Relay
          → Relay finds Client A (not expired)
          → Returns: port + addresses
          → Client B connects to Client A ✓

T=0:45    Cleanup job runs (every 5 min)
          → Checks all broadcasts
          → Client A broadcast not expired yet
          → No action

T=1:00    Client A is still online
          → Broadcast expires: expires_at < NOW()
          → Cleanup job runs
          → Deletes expired broadcast
          → Client A no longer discoverable

If Client A had sent heartbeat (Phase 2B+):
T=0:30    Client A sends heartbeat
          → Relay extends expiration: expires_at = NOW() + 3600
          → Broadcast stays active
          → Client A continues discoverable
```
