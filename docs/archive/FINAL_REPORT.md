## 🔄 Architecture Transformation

### OLD FLOW (DCC-based)
```
KeySection → ServerSection → BroadcastSection → DccChatroom
                                                   (deleted)
```

### NEW FLOW (RemoteHouse-based)
```
KeySection → ServerSection → ClientsList (+ Refresh) → RemoteHouse
                                                            ↓
                                                    [View Remote Files]
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### File Type Protection ✅
- **Whitelist Approach:** Only safe file types allowed
- **Blocked Types:** HTML, JS, executables, system files
- **Allowed Types:** Markdown, CSS, images, video, audio
- **Content-Type Headers:** Correctly set for each file type

### Certificate Security (Ready to integrate) 🔐
- Utility functions created for:
  - Certificate verification
  - Public key encryption
  - Private key decryption
  - Session management
- TODO: Full Web Crypto API integration
- TODO: Real certificate validation

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

### ✅ Can Test Now (With Mock Data)
```
1. Start app: cd client && npm run tauri:dev
2. Generate/load key
3. Register with server
4. See ClientsList appear
5. Click Refresh button
6. Click Visit on any client
7. RemoteHouse modal opens
8. Click files to preview
9. Click Close to return
```

### ⏳ Ready After Task 3

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

### 1. Test the UI (5 minutes)
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
# Follow Quick Start in QUICK_REFERENCE.md
```

### 2. Review the Code (20 minutes)
- Check new components in `client/src/components/RemoteHouse/`
- Review backend changes in `client/src-tauri/src/main.rs`
- See main flow in `client/src/app/page.tsx`

### 3. Plan Next Steps (10 minutes)
- Read `TODO_REMAINING.md` for Tasks 3, 9, 10
- Estimated time: 7-10 hours remaining
- Priority: Task 3 (server endpoint) unblocks everything

---

## 🚀 Remaining Work (7-10 hours)

### Task 3: Server Certificate Endpoint (2-3 hours)
**What's needed:**
- Create `GET /api/users/{email}/certificate` endpoint
- Store certificates during registration
- Return PEM format certificate
- Handle 404 for non-existent users

**Blocking:** RemoteHouse file API, certificate retrieval

### Task 9: Integration Testing (2-3 hours)
**What's needed:**
- Test complete registration → ClientsList → RemoteHouse flow
- Verify refresh button works
- Test file preview rendering
- Handle errors gracefully

**Blocking:** Release readiness, deployment

### Task 10: E2E Cypress Tests (3-4 hours)
**What's needed:**
- Automated test suite
- Test all user flows
- Test error scenarios
- Test file type security

**Blocking:** CI/CD integration, production readiness
