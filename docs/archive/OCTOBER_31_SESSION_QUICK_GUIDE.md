# October 31, 2025: Architecture Update - Quick Navigation

**Session Summary:** Architected complete redesign from centralized relay tracking to decentralized P2P peer discovery with gossip protocol and WebTorrent integration.

---

## What Changed: The Vision

**From This:**
```
All Clients ‚Üí Single Relay Tracker ‚Üí Everything
(Centralized, single point of failure, relay stores all peer info)
```

**To This:**
```
Client ‚Üí Bootstrap Nodes (for discovery)
       ‚Üí Gossip Network (peer-to-peer info sharing)
       ‚Üí WebTorrent (distributed file seeding)
(Decentralized, resilient, privacy-respecting)
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Impact | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Bootstrap Nodes Only** | Relay only stores broadcasting peers | Privacy: silent peers remain hidden |
| **Gossip Protocol** | No central coordinator needed | Resilience: works when relay down |
| **IP Sharing Rules** | Only broadcasting peers expose IP | Security: non-broadcasting peers anonymous |
| **WebTorrent** | Large files via torrent network | Scalability: no single peer bottleneck |
| **Phased Migration** | Backward compatibility period | Risk reduction: gradual rollout |

## Protocol at a Glance

### 6 Message Types

| Type | Direction | Purpose | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **HELLO** | Bidirectional | Connect & exchange capabilities | "Hi, I'm Alice, I have 3 repos" |
| **PEER_ANNOUNCEMENT** | Gossip (fan-out=3) | Spread peer info (respects IP sharing) | "Bob is online with films repo" |
| **PEER_REQUEST** | Gossip (TTL=16) | Search for peers with specific repos | "Who has documentaries repo?" |
| **PEER_LIST_RESPONSE** | Reply to request | Answer with matching peers | "David and Eve have it" |
| **HEARTBEAT** | Gossip (TTL=2) | Keep-alive, detect downtime | "I'm still here" |
| **PEER_UPDATE** | Gossip (TTL=32) | Announce status/repo changes | "I added a new repo" |

### Key Parameters

```
Fan-out:              3 random peers
Initial TTL:          32 hops (reaches ~59,000 peers)
Heartbeat interval:   30 seconds
Message retention:    Bloom filter (100K messages)
Peer expiration:      2 hours no heartbeat
Bootstrap expiration: 1 hour (same as current relay)
```

## Security Model

### Authentication
‚úÖ Certificate-based (mutual TLS)  
‚úÖ Fingerprint verification  
‚úÖ Email-to-peer_id mapping (prevents Sybil)

### IP Sharing
‚úÖ ONLY broadcasting peers expose IP  
‚úÖ Non-broadcasting peers invisible to network  
‚úÖ Gossip enforces this automatically  
‚úÖ Relay tracker enforces at bootstrap level

### Message Security
‚úÖ TTL validation (0-32)  
‚úÖ Timestamp validation (¬±30s clock skew)  
‚úÖ Signature verification  
‚úÖ Message deduplication  
‚úÖ Replay attack prevention

## Data Flow Examples

### Example 1: Bootstrap Registration
```
User enables broadcast ‚Üí Generate peer_id ‚Üí POST /bootstrap/register
                                           ‚Üí Relay stores as bootstrap
                                           ‚Üí Returns other bootstraps
                                           ‚Üí Client connects & starts gossip
```

### Example 2: New Peer Joins
```
Peer connects to bootstrap ‚Üí Receives peer list ‚Üí Contacts peers
                          ‚Üí Receives gossip announcements
                          ‚Üí Local table populated with other peers
                          ‚Üí Can discover repos via gossip
```

### Example 3: Silent Peer Discovers
```
Non-broadcasting peer sends PEER_REQUEST for "films"
                          ‚Üí Bootstrap responds with ["Alice", "Bob"]
                          ‚Üí Both have socket_addresses (they broadcast)
                          ‚Üí Silent peer connects (outbound only)
                          ‚Üí Remains invisible to network
```

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Relay Query Time
- **OLD:** Always query relay (1-2 second RTT)
- **NEW:** First check local gossip cache (instant)

### Scalability
- **OLD:** Relay bandwidth O(n), grows with peers
- **NEW:** Gossip O(log n), scales logarithmically

### Relay Downtime
- **OLD:** All peer discovery fails
- **NEW:** Existing peers continue, new peers can join network

### Privacy
- **OLD:** Relay knows all peer IPs
- **NEW:** Bootstrap only knows broadcasting peer IPs

### Network Resilience
- **OLD:** Single point of failure
- **NEW:** Network continues even if bootstrap down

---

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Team Review** - Share documents with team for feedback
2. **Database Planning** - Plan bootstrap_nodes schema changes
3. **Start Phase 1** - Create bootstrap registration endpoints
4. **Start Phase 2** - Begin gossip.rs implementation
5. **Testing Strategy** - Plan test cases for gossip protocol

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: Won't this create a network split if bootstrap goes down?**  
A: No. Existing peers continue using their peer table. New peers can't join, but that's just like before. When bootstrap comes back, network recovers.

**Q: How do non-broadcasting peers get discovered?**  
A: They don't. They can discover others, but aren't discoverable themselves. They remain private/hidden.

**Q: What about WebTorrent compatibility?**  
A: Works with web browsers via WebTorrent-over-WebSocket. Desktop clients use full torrent protocol.

**Q: How long until information reaches all peers?**  
A: With fan-out=3, TTL=32: typically 50-250 seconds for full network convergence.

**Q: Can we bootstrap from multiple sources?**  
A: Yes. Clients can connect to multiple bootstrap nodes in parallel for faster discovery.

**Q: What if a malicious peer joins?**  
A: Certificate verification prevents spoofing. Gossip deduplication prevents floods. IP exposure limited to broadcasting peers only.
