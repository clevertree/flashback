# Certificate Security Rule Implementation Summary

**Commit**: `5cefb66`  
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE & PUSHED

## Overview
Implemented critical security rule: **Public certificates must ONLY come from the relay tracker server, never from the host client.**

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced RemoteHouse Component
**File**: `client/src/components/RemoteHouse/RemoteHouse.tsx`
- Added `publicCertificate?: string` prop to `RemoteHouseProps`
- Updated component to receive certificate parameter
- Certificate is passed from verified relay tracker lookup

### 2. Validated Certificate in FriendsListSection
**File**: `client/src/components/FriendsListSection/FriendsListSection.tsx`
- Enhanced `handleVisitFriend()` with security validation
- Validates certificate is returned from relay tracker
- Throws error if certificate is missing
- Includes detailed security comments explaining the rule
- Enforces that certificates come ONLY from `apiLookup()` call

### 3. Updated Data Interfaces
**File**: `client/src/apiTypes.ts`
- Added `publicCertificate?: string` to `RegisterResultData`
- Added `publicCertificate?: string` to `ClientInfo`
- Added JSDoc comments with security rule statement:
  ```
  SECURITY RULE: Must only come from relay tracker, never from the client.
  The relay tracker verifies certificate ownership and ensures secure data transfer.
  ```

### 4. Updated Main Page Component
**File**: `client/src/app/page.tsx`
- Pass `publicCertificate` from selected client to RemoteHouse
- Pass `clientEmail` to RemoteHouse for better identification
- Ensures certificate flows from relay tracker → FriendsListSection → page.tsx → RemoteHouse

### 5. Created Security Documentation
**File**: `SECURITY_CERTIFICATE_RULE.md`
- Comprehensive security rule documentation
- Explains rationale and implementation
- Documents data flow and enforcement points
- Specifies client-side and server-side requirements
- Defines violations and review guidelines

## Security Architecture

```
User clicks "Visit Friend"
    ↓
Client → Relay Tracker: apiLookup(email)
    ↓
Relay Tracker validates email ownership
    ↓
Relay Tracker returns:
  - Socket info (IP, port)
  - Public certificate for that email
    ↓
FriendsListSection validates cert is present
    ↓
ClientInfo created with verified certificate
    ↓
page.tsx passes to RemoteHouse
    ↓
RemoteHouse uses cert for TLS handshake
```

## Key Enforcement Points

1. **Certificate Validation** (FriendsListSection.tsx)
   ```typescript
   if (!publicCertificate) {
       throw new Error('No public certificate received from relay tracker. Cannot establish secure connection.');
   }
   ```

2. **Type Safety** (apiTypes.ts)
   - Security comments on all certificate fields
   - Clear documentation of the rule

3. **Data Flow** (page.tsx)
   - Certificate only added to RemoteHouse when coming from validated friend visit
   - Email address preserved for audit trail

4. **API Integration** (FriendsListSection.tsx)
   - Only calls `apiLookup()` to relay tracker
   - Never accepts certificates from other sources
   - Validates presence before use

## Benefits

✅ **Authentication**: Certificate proves peer identity via relay tracker  
✅ **Integrity**: Relay tracker vouches for certificate ownership  
✅ **Non-Repudiation**: Server can verify certificate chain  
✅ **Scalability**: Works with any number of users  
✅ **Security**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks via false certificates  

## Future Work

- Implement server-side `/api/lookup/{email}` endpoint
- Ensure certificate is returned in broadcast responses
- Implement certificate rotation and expiration
- Add health checks (Phase 4)
- Remove hardcoded friends when search feature added (Phase 4)
