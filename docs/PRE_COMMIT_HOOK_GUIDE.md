# Pre-Commit Hook Enhancement Summary

## Overview

The project's pre-commit git hook has been enhanced to include comprehensive unit test verification alongside build verification. This ensures that **no broken code or failing tests can be committed** to the repository.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Pre-Commit Hook Logic

**Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**Previous Flow** (2 checks):
```
Pre-commit → Build Next.js → Build Cargo → Commit?
```

**New Flow** (4 checks):
```
Pre-commit → Jest Tests → Build Next.js → Build Cargo → Cargo Tests → Commit?
```

### 2. Enhanced Hook Script

**File**: `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`

Added two new verification steps:

#### Step 1: Jest Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test -- --passWithNoTests
```
- Runs React component unit tests
- Must pass before proceeding
- Tests location: `src/__tests__/`
- Current: **5 tests passing**

#### Step 4: Cargo Tests
```bash
cargo test --lib
```
- Runs Rust library unit tests
- Must pass before proceeding
- Tests location: `crates/*/src/` (lib.rs files)
- Validates business logic and utilities

### 3. Updated Documentation

**File**: `scripts/GIT_HOOKS_README.md`

Added detailed documentation of all 4 verification checks:
- Jest unit tests
- Next.js build
- Cargo build
- Cargo tests

---

## Verification Workflow

### Complete Pre-Commit Checklist

When running `git commit`, the hook now verifies:

| # | Check | Command | Purpose | Status |
|---|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | Jest Unit Tests | `npm run test` | React component tests | ✅ 5/5 passing |
| 2️⃣ | Next.js Build | `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript/React | ✅ Passing |
| 3️⃣ | Cargo Build | `npm run tauri:build` | Compile Rust code | ✅ Passing |
| 4️⃣ | Cargo Tests | `cargo test --lib` | Rust unit tests | ✅ Passing |

### Example Output

```
========================================
  Pre-Commit Build Verification
========================================

[1/4] Running unit tests...

✓ Unit tests passed

[2/4] Building Next.js application...

✓ Next.js build successful

[3/4] Building Rust project...

✓ Cargo build successful

[4/4] Running Cargo tests...

✓ Cargo tests passed

========================================
✓ All builds passed!
✓ Commit allowed
========================================
```

### Failure Handling

If any check fails, the commit is **rejected** with detailed error output:

```
✗ Unit tests failed!

Test Output:
  FAIL  src/__tests__/KeyManagement.test.tsx
    KeyManagement Component
      ✗ generates keypair correctly

========================================
✗ Verification failed!
✗ Commit rejected
========================================

To commit anyway, use:
  git commit --no-verify
```

---

## Unit Tests Coverage

### Jest Tests (React)
- **File**: `src/__tests__/KeyManagement.test.tsx`
- **Tests**: 5 tests
- **Coverage**: KeyManagement component
  - Rendering
  - Generate keypair functionality
  - Identity display
  - Save button visibility
  - Complete user flow

### Cargo Tests (Rust)
- **Files**: 
  - `crates/fabric-core/src/crypto.rs` (crypto functions)
  - `crates/fabric-core/src/fabric.rs` (network operations)
  - `crates/fabric-core/src/torrent.rs` (P2P logic)
- **Scope**: Library tests (`--lib` flag)
- **Current**: All tests passing

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Quality Assurance**
- Catches failing tests before they reach main branch
- Prevents regressions from broken commits
- Maintains high code quality standards

### 2. **Early Feedback**
- Developers know about failures immediately
- Can fix issues before pushing
- Reduces CI/CD failures

### 3. **Build Integrity**
- Ensures codebase always builds on main
- Prevents "broken main" scenarios
- Consistent stable state

### 4. **Test Discipline**
- Encourages writing and maintaining tests
- Tests run locally, not just on CI
- Developers responsible for test quality

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Clear colored output (RED for failures, GREEN for success)
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Simple bypass option (`--no-verify`) when needed

---

## Usage

### Setup the Hook

```bash
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

This installs the hook from `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

### Verify Installation

```bash
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x ... pre-commit
```

### Normal Commit Workflow

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
# Pre-commit hook runs automatically
# If all checks pass → commit succeeds
# If any check fails → commit rejected
```

### Bypass Hook (Emergency Only)

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
# Skips all pre-commit checks
# Use only when absolutely necessary
```

---

## Test Commands for Manual Verification

Run these individually to test specific components:

```bash
# Jest unit tests only
npm run test

# Next.js build only
npm run build

# Cargo build only
npm run tauri:build

# Cargo tests only
cargo test --lib

# Full pre-commit simulation
# Run all 4 in sequence manually
```

---

## Performance Impact

Pre-commit hook execution time (approximate):

| Check | Time |
|-------|------|
| Jest Unit Tests | 0.4s |
| Next.js Build | 30-60s |
| Cargo Build | 20-50s |
| Cargo Tests | 5-15s |
| **Total** | **~1-2 minutes** |

**Note**: First build after changes may be slower. Subsequent commits are typically faster due to caching.

---

## Integration with CI/CD

This pre-commit hook complements the CI/CD pipeline:

```
Developer's Machine               GitHub/CI Server
└─ Pre-commit hook                └─ CI Pipeline
   └─ 4 checks (1-2 min)            └─ Full test suite (5-10 min)
   └─ Fail early, fast              └─ Comprehensive checks
   └─ Push only if passes           └─ Deploy if all pass
```

**Result**: Only quality code reaches CI/CD, reducing feedback loops.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

**Problem**: Commit succeeds without running hook

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check hook exists
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check hook is executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Reinstall hook
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

### Tests Fail Locally But Pass on CI

**Problem**: Different environment or test data

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run exact same command as hook
npm run test -- --passWithNoTests
cargo test --lib

# Check environment differences
npm --version
cargo --version
node --version
```

### Build Hangs During Commit

**Problem**: Pre-commit hook stuck on long build

**Solution**:
- Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel
- Check for disk space
- Check for network issues
- Run `npm run build` manually to debug

### Need to Commit Without Tests

**Emergency bypass**:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency fix"
```

**Recommended**: Always fix issues instead of bypassing.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the pre-commit hook:

1. **Selective Testing**
   - Run only tests for changed files
   - Skip expensive tests for documentation-only changes

2. **Caching**
   - Cache build artifacts between commits
   - Reduce verification time for unchanged code

3. **Custom Rules**
   - Lint check before build
   - Code style validation (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Type checking (TypeScript strict mode)

4. **Parallel Execution**
   - Run Jest and Cargo tests in parallel
   - Reduce total verification time

5. **Metrics & Reporting**
   - Track hook execution times
   - Report test coverage trends
   - Generate pre-commit reports
