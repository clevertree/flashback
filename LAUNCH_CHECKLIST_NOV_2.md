## 🎯 The 4 Endpoints You'll Build

```
✅ 1. POST /api/relay/register
   No auth | {certificate, email} → {client_id}
   
✅ 2. POST /api/relay/broadcast/ready
   Mutual TLS | {port, addresses} → {broadcast_id, expires_in}
   
✅ 3. GET /api/relay/broadcast/lookup?email=...
   Mutual TLS | Query param → {email, port, addresses}
   
✅ 4. GET /api/relay/broadcast/list
   Mutual TLS | No input → [{email, port, addresses}, ...]

❌ NO: POST /api/relay/broadcast/heartbeat
   (Client-to-client only, added Phase 2B)
```

## 📋 Your Monday Schedule

### Morning (9:00-10:00 AM)
- [ ] **9:00** Open CLARIFICATIONS_OCTOBER_30.md (10 min)
- [ ] **9:10** Read mutual TLS section (10 min)
- [ ] **9:20** Read RELAY_TRACKER_PROTOCOL.md (20 min)
- [ ] **9:40** Read PHASE_2A_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (20 min)
- [ ] **10:00** Ready to code ✓

### Late Morning (10:00-12:00)
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL connection
- [ ] Read Day 1 tasks (database setup)
- [ ] Create `/server/lib/db.ts` (database connection)
- [ ] Run migrations (create tables)
- [ ] Test database queries work

### Afternoon (1:00-5:00)
- [ ] Start Day 2: Register endpoint
- [ ] Create `/server/app/api/relay/register/route.ts`
- [ ] Parse certificates
- [ ] Test with curl

---

## 🔐 Understanding Mutual TLS (60-Second Version)

```
Regular HTTPS:
  Client: "Who are you, server?"
  Server: "I'm example.com, here's my cert"
  Client: "OK, I trust you" ✓

Mutual TLS:
  Client: "Who are you, server?"
  Server: "I'm Relay, here's my cert"
  Server: "Who are YOU, client?"
  Client: "I'm user@example.com, here's MY cert"
  Server: "I know you! Connection allowed" ✓

Result: BOTH sides prove who they are!
```

**For Relay Tracker:**
1. Client registers certificate once: `POST /api/relay/register`
2. For future calls: Use mutual TLS to prove it's really them
3. No tokens, no sessions, no expiration management
4. Extract email from certificate CN field
5. Done!

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Need

### Software
- [x] Node.js 18+ (`which node`)
- [x] npm/pnpm (`npm -v`)
- [x] PostgreSQL running (`psql --version`)
- [x] Git (`git --version`)

### Node Packages (will install)
```
npm install node-forge pg node-cron
```

### Optional
- VS Code with TypeScript support
- Postman or insomnia (for testing)
- curl (for manual testing)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (End of Day 1)

By end of Day 1 (Monday afternoon):
- [x] Database connected from Node.js
- [x] `clients` table created
- [x] `broadcasts` table created
- [x] Can insert test data
- [x] Can query test data
- [x] `.env.local` configured

**Sign-off:** Database is working ✓

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (End of Day 2)

By end of Day 2 (Tuesday afternoon):
- [x] Register endpoint working
- [x] Valid cert + email → 200 OK
- [x] Duplicate email → 409 Conflict
- [x] Malformed cert → 400 Bad Request
- [x] Tests passing for all cases

**Sign-off:** Registration working ✓

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### DON'T DO
❌ Don't build a heartbeat endpoint to Relay  
❌ Don't send heartbeat to Relay (Phase 2B)  
❌ Don't skip mutual TLS (required for endpoints 2-4)  
❌ Don't forget certificate validation  

### DO DO
✅ Use TTL-based expiration (1 hour)  
✅ Implement background cleanup (every 5 min)  
✅ Extract email from certificate CN  
✅ Store certificate in database  
✅ Write tests for all endpoints  
✅ Reference PHASE_2A_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md daily

## 📞 Quick Reference

**Need to remember:**
- Relay Tracker: Backend service (Next.js)
- 4 endpoints: register, broadcast/ready, lookup, list
- Mutual TLS: For endpoints 2, 3, 4 (not 1)
- Heartbeat: Phase 2B, not Phase 2A
- Duration: 6-8 days
- TTL: 1 hour expiration
- Cleanup: Every 5 minutes

**In case of confusion:**
1. Read CLARIFICATIONS_OCTOBER_30.md
2. Read RELAY_TRACKER_PROTOCOL.md
3. Read PHASE_2A_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
4. Reference PHASE_2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
