## Architecture Overview

### The Vision

**Before (Current):**
```
All Clients ────────► Single Relay Tracker ────────► All Responses
             (Query)                        (Response)
```
- Single point of failure
- Relay stores ALL peer info
- Scalability bottleneck
- Privacy concern (relay sees everything)

**After (Designed):**
```
Clients ──► Bootstrap Nodes ──┐
                              ├─► Gossip Network ──► Eventually Consistent
                              ├─► Information Sharing (Peer-to-Peer)
                              └─► WebTorrent DHT (Large Files)
```
- Decentralized (no single point of failure)
- Relay only stores bootstrap peers
- Gossip scales logarithmically: O(log n)
- Privacy: Only broadcasting peers expose IP

### Six Core Components

1. **Bootstrap Nodes** - High-capacity peers that register with relay for discovery
2. **Gossip Protocol** - Peer-to-peer information sharing (6 message types)
3. **Peer Table** - Local cache of known peers with scoring
4. **IP Sharing Rules** - Only broadcasting peers expose addresses
5. **WebTorrent Client** - Distribute large files outside repos
6. **Security Layer** - Certificate-based auth + message verification

### Six Message Types

| Type | Purpose | Direction |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **HELLO** | Establish connection & exchange capabilities | Direct |
| **PEER_ANNOUNCEMENT** | Spread peer info (fan-out=3) | Broadcast |
| **PEER_REQUEST** | Search for peers with repos | Broadcast |
| **PEER_LIST_RESPONSE** | Reply with matching peers | Reply |
| **HEARTBEAT** | Keep-alive signals | Broadcast |
| **PEER_UPDATE** | Status/repo changes | Broadcast |

## Key Design Decisions Explained

### 1. Bootstrap Nodes (Not All Peers)
**Decision:** Only clients that enable broadcast become bootstrap nodes

**Why:** 
- Reduces relay storage (only ~10-20% of peers)
- Protects privacy of silent peers (invisible to network)
- Bootstrap nodes = high-capacity, reliable peers

**Impact:**
- Non-broadcasting peers can't be discovered
- Non-broadcasting peers can't accept incoming connections
- They can still discover others and connect outbound

### 2. Gossip Protocol (Not Request-Response)
**Decision:** Use epidemic algorithm for peer information sharing

**Why:**
- Decentralized (no coordinator needed)
- Resilient (works when relay is down)
- Scalable (information spreads logarithmically)

**Impact:**
- Temporary inconsistencies (eventual consistency)
- Information takes 5-30 seconds to spread
- Requires message deduplication

### 3. IP Sharing Rules (Security by Default)
**Decision:** Only expose IP for peers that explicitly broadcast

**Why:**
- Privacy protection (silent peers remain hidden)
- Security (attackers can't discover non-broadcasting peers)
- User choice (opt-in to public IP exposure)

**Impact:**
- Silent peers depend on relay for incoming connections
- Gossip protocol enforces this at message level
- No way to accidentally expose IP

### 4. WebTorrent (Not Direct P2P)
**Decision:** Use WebTorrent for large file distribution

**Why:**
- Better than single-peer bottleneck
- Works in web browsers (JavaScript)
- Standard BitTorrent protocol (interoperable)

**Impact:**
- Need torrent client implementation
- DHT integration required
- Seed/download coordination needed

### 5. Phased Migration (Not Big Bang)
**Decision:** Gradual rollout with backward compatibility

**Why:**
- Lower risk (can revert if issues)
- Test in production gradually
- Existing systems continue working

**Impact:**
- Temporary code complexity (dual operation)
- Relay still running in Phase 1-2
- Full deprecation in Phase 3

## Quick Reference

### Parameters
- **Fan-out:** 3 random peers (message forwarding)
- **TTL:** 32 hops (reaches ~59,000 peers)
- **Heartbeat:** 30 seconds (keep-alive)
- **Peer expiration:** 2 hours no activity
- **Bootstrap expiration:** 1 hour (same as relay)

### Endpoints
```
POST   /api/bootstrap/register              Register as bootstrap
DELETE /api/bootstrap/unregister            Leave bootstrap role
GET    /api/bootstrap/discover?repos=...    Find peers with repos
GET    /api/bootstrap/peers                 List other bootstraps
```

### Data Structure (PeerInfo)
```typescript
{
  email, peer_id, public_certificate,
  socket_addresses (if broadcasting),
  port, is_broadcasting, is_bootstrap,
  repositories, availability_score (0-100),
  performance_score (0-100), bandwidth_estimate,
  discovered_at, last_seen, expires_at
}
```

## Questions & Discussion Points

**Q: Should bootstrap nodes have geographic distribution?**  
A: Yes (future). Start with simple load balancing, add geo-distribution later.

**Q: What about peer reputation/scoring?**  
A: Included in design. Availability (uptime) and performance (latency) scores.

**Q: Can we use this for other P2P networks?**  
A: Yes. Gossip protocol is generic and can be adapted.

**Q: Should we implement consensus for bootstrap decisions?**  
A: Future enhancement. Start simple (no consensus), add later if needed.

**Q: How do we handle network partitions?**  
A: Gossip naturally re-merges partitions when they reconnect.
