# Policy Enforcement Rules - Final Summary

## Enforced Policies (November 1, 2025)

### ✅ Policy #1: Git Commit Verification
**File**: `GIT_COMMIT_POLICY.md`

**The Rule**:
- ❌ NEVER use `--no-verify` flag in commits
- ✅ ALL commits MUST pass pre-commit verification
- ✅ NO EXCEPTIONS allowed

**What Gets Verified Before Each Commit**:
1. ✅ Jest unit tests pass
2. ✅ Next.js builds successfully
3. ✅ Cargo builds successfully
4. ✅ Cargo tests pass

**When Commit Fails**:
1. Read the error message
2. Fix the failing test or build
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Retry commit: `git commit -m "message"`
5. Do NOT use `--no-verify`

---

### ✅ Policy #2: File Creation Tools
**File**: `FILE_CREATION_POLICY.md`

**The Rule**:
- ❌ NEVER use `cat` to create files
- ❌ NEVER use heredoc syntax for file creation
- ❌ NEVER use `echo` redirects for files
- ✅ ALWAYS use `create_file` tool for new files
- ✅ ALWAYS use `replace_string_in_file` tool for edits

**Tool Usage**:
```
create_file               → Use for creating new files
replace_string_in_file   → Use for editing existing files
run_in_terminal          → Use for running commands ONLY (not file ops)
```

**Why**:
- All operations are tracked and auditable
- Clear error messages if something fails
- Consistent approach across the project
- Seamless integration with VS Code

## Policy Documents Created

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `GIT_COMMIT_POLICY.md` | Enforce pre-commit verification | ✅ Staged |
| `FILE_CREATION_POLICY.md` | Require proper file tools | ✅ Staged |
| `POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_STATUS.md` | Implementation status | ✅ Staged |
| `POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_RULES_SUMMARY.md` | This file | ✅ Ready |

---

## Current Status

### Staged Files (Ready for Commit)
```
✅ FILE_CREATION_POLICY.md
✅ GIT_COMMIT_POLICY.md
✅ POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_STATUS.md
```

### Enforcement Implementation
```
✅ Pre-commit hook updated
✅ --no-verify suggestion removed
✅ Clear error messages added
✅ Actionable troubleshooting provided
✅ Policy documents created
```

---

## Key Enforcement Points

### Git Commit Policy
- **Enforcement**: Pre-commit hook blocks violations
- **Scope**: Every single commit to the repository
- **Severity**: Blocks commit entirely - no workarounds
- **Benefits**: Stable main branch, quality builds, passing tests

### File Creation Policy
- **Enforcement**: Code review and tool requirements
- **Scope**: All file creation operations
- **Severity**: Will be flagged in review and reverted
- **Benefits**: Auditability, consistency, error handling

---

## Compliance Requirements

All developers must:
1. ✅ Never use `--no-verify` in commits
2. ✅ Fix build/test failures before committing
3. ✅ Use `create_file` tool for new files
4. ✅ Use `replace_string_in_file` tool for edits
5. ✅ Read and follow policy documents
6. ✅ Accept no exceptions policy
7. ✅ Commit to code quality standards

---

## Benefits Summary

### Git Commit Policy Benefits
- ✅ Code Quality - Only clean code reaches main
- ✅ Test Coverage - All tests pass before commit
- ✅ Build Integrity - No broken builds
- ✅ CI/CD Success - Matches pipeline checks
- ✅ Team Confidence - Reliable main branch

### File Creation Policy Benefits
- ✅ Auditability - All operations logged
- ✅ Consistency - Same approach everywhere
- ✅ Error Handling - Proper error feedback
- ✅ Trackability - Clear conversation history
- ✅ Integration - Seamless tool integration

---

## FAQ

**Q: What if I use `--no-verify` by mistake?**
A: Don't. It's prohibited. Fix the actual issue instead.

**Q: Can I get an exception?**
A: No. There are no exceptions to these policies.

**Q: What if the tests are failing?**
A: Fix them. That's the point - they should pass before committing.

**Q: Why can't I use `cat` to create files?**
A: Because it's not auditable, not tracked, and doesn't provide error feedback. Use proper tools.

**Q: What if I already used `--no-verify`?**
A: That commit will need to be addressed. Going forward, follow policy.

**Q: Can I use `echo` to create files?**
A: No. Use the `create_file` tool instead.

## Next Commit Process

When ready to commit these policies:

```bash
# All three files are staged
git status
# Shows: 3 files staged for commit

# Commit will trigger pre-commit hook which runs:
# 1. npm run test -- --passWithNoTests
# 2. npm run build
# 3. npm run tauri:build
# 4. cargo test --lib

# If all pass:
git commit -m "docs: enforce strict git commit and file creation policies"

# If any fail:
# Follow error messages to fix issues
# Then retry commit
```

## Enforcement Mechanism

### Pre-Commit Hook
- Runs automatically before each commit
- Blocks commit if any check fails
- Provides detailed error messages
- Shows actionable troubleshooting steps
- No option to bypass (--no-verify prohibited)

### Code Review
- Will check for `cat` usage in commits
- Will verify proper file tools were used
- Will ensure policies are followed
- Will flag violations for discussion

### Team Accountability
- All developers held to same standards
- Clear policies documented
- No exceptions or workarounds
- Violations have consequences

---

## Summary

**Two comprehensive policies have been established and are now active:**

1. ✅ Git Commit Policy (GIT_COMMIT_POLICY.md)
   - Never use `--no-verify`
   - All commits must pass verification
   - No exceptions

2. ✅ File Creation Policy (FILE_CREATION_POLICY.md)
