- [ ] Update code: `listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:0")?`
- [ ] Test server is reachable from other machine
- [ ] Test server is reachable from same machine
- [ ] Consider IPv6 binding (`::`)?

### Get Local IP Addresses (2.2.2)
- [ ] Add `ipnetwork` crate to `Cargo.toml`
- [ ] Create function `get_local_addresses() -> Vec<String>`
- [ ] Get all network interfaces

```rust
fn get_local_addresses() -> Vec<String> {
  use pnet::datalink;
  let mut addresses = Vec::new();
  
  for interface in datalink::interfaces() {
    for ip in interface.ips {
      match ip.ip() {
        IpAddr::V4(addr) => {
          if !addr.is_loopback() {
            addresses.push(addr.to_string());
          }
        }
        IpAddr::V6(addr) => {
          if !addr.is_loopback() && !addr.is_link_local() {
            addresses.push(addr.to_string());
          }
        }
      }
    }

  "addresses": get_local_addresses()?
}))?;
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2 days

---

## CLIENT CERTIFICATE & REGISTRATION (2.3) - `client/src-tauri/src`

### Generate Self-Signed Certificate (2.3.1)
- [ ] Add `rcgen` crate to `Cargo.toml`
- [ ] Create function `generate_certificate(email: &str) -> Result<(String, String)>`
  - Returns: (certificate_pem, private_key_pem)
- [ ] Use ed25519 for key generation
- [ ] Set CN=email in certificate
- [ ] Set valid_for_days = 365
- [ ] Handle certificate generation errors
- [ ] Test certificate format

**Pseudo-code:**
```rust
use rcgen::generate_simple_self_signed_cert;

fn generate_certificate(email: &str) -> Result<(String, String)> {
  let subject_alt_names = vec![email.to_string()];
  let cert = generate_simple_self_signed_cert(
    subject_alt_names,
    365
  )?;
  Ok((cert.serialize_pem()?, cert.serialize_private_key_pem()?))
}
```

### Store Certificate Locally (2.3.1 Support)
- [ ] Use Tauri `app_dir()` for storage
- [ ] Create directory: `~/.dcc/certificates/`
- [ ] Store: `client.crt` (certificate)
- [ ] Store: `client.key` (private key)
- [ ] Protect private key (0600 permissions)
- [ ] Load on startup if exists
- [ ] Generate if missing

### Register with Relay on Startup (2.3.2)
- [ ] Create function `register_with_relay(email: &str, cert: &str, relay_url: &str)`
- [ ] POST to `{relay_url}/api/relay/register`
- [ ] Send body: `{certificate: cert, email: email}`
- [ ] Handle response:
  - [ ] 200 OK: Log success, continue
  - [ ] 409 Conflict: Email exists, show error, ask user for new email
  - [ ] Other errors: Retry or fail gracefully
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Test with mock relay server

### Gather & Send Address List (2.3.3)
- [ ] Create function `broadcast_ready(relay_url: &str, port: u16, addresses: Vec<String>)`
- [ ] POST to `{relay_url}/api/relay/broadcast/ready`
- [ ] Send body: `{port, addresses, capabilities: {...}}`
- [ ] Include client certificate (mutual TLS)
- [ ] Handle response: `{broadcast_id, expires_in}`
- [ ] Store broadcast_id for heartbeat
- [ ] Handle errors

**Pseudo-code:**
```rust
async fn broadcast_ready(
  relay_url: &str,
  port: u16,
  addresses: Vec<String>
) -> Result<String> {
  let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .identity(load_client_identity()?)
    .build()?;
  
  let response = client
    .post(&format!("{}/api/relay/broadcast/ready", relay_url))
    .json(&json!({
      "port": port,
      "addresses": addresses
    }))
    .send()
    .await?;
  
  let body: BroadcastResponse = response.json().await?;
  Ok(body.broadcast_id)
}
```

### Note on Heartbeat (2.3.4)

**IMPORTANT:** Heartbeat is NOT sent to Relay Tracker in Phase 2A.

- Broadcasts stay alive via 1-hour TTL
- Background cleanup deletes expired broadcasts
- Client goes offline ‚Üí broadcast expires naturally
- Heartbeat is PHASE 2B+ (client-to-client keepalive)
- Phase 2B will add peer-to-peer health checks

### Error Handling & Logging (2.3 Support)
- [ ] Log certificate generation
- [ ] Log relay registration success/failure
- [ ] Log broadcast ready success/failure
- [ ] Emit events to UI for user feedback
- [ ] Handle network timeouts gracefully

**Estimated Effort:** 3.5-4 days

## REMOTEHOUSE UPDATES (2.4) - `client/src/components/RemoteHouse`

### Query Relay for Peer List (2.4.1)
**Challenge:** Browser can't do mutual TLS. Solution: Use Tauri bridge.

- [ ] Create Tauri command: `query_relay_peers(relay_url: String) -> Vec<Peer>`
- [ ] In Rust:
  - [ ] Query relay `/api/relay/broadcast/list`
  - [ ] Validate TLS cert
  - [ ] Return peer list
- [ ] In React:
  - [ ] Call Tauri command on component mount
  - [ ] Handle loading state
  - [ ] Cache result (5 minute TTL)
  - [ ] Show peer list in UI
  - [ ] Refresh on user request

**Peer struct:**
```typescript
interface Peer {
  email: string;
  port: number;
  addresses: string[];
  lastSeen: string;
}
```

### Address Try-Order Logic (2.4.2)
- [ ] Create function `connectToPeer(peer: Peer) -> Promise<Response>`
- [ ] Try addresses in order:
  1. Local IPv4 (192.168... or 10...)
  2. Local IPv6 (fe80:...)
  3. Public IPv4
  4. Public IPv6
- [ ] On each failure, try next address
- [ ] On success: Set `connectedPeer`, cache winning address
- [ ] Implement timeout (5 seconds per address)
- [ ] Log all attempts

**Pseudo-code:**
```typescript
async function connectToPeer(peer: Peer): Promise<string> {
  for (const address of peer.addresses) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        `http://${address}:${peer.port}/api/files`,
        {timeout: 5000}
      );
      if (response.ok) {
        return address; // Success!
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(`${address} failed: ${e.message}`);
    }
  }
  throw new Error('All addresses failed');
}
```

### Peer Status Indicators (2.4.3)
- [ ] Add peer status enum: `online | offline | checking | error`
- [ ] Show visual indicator in UI
  - [ ] `‚óè` Green: Online (successfully connected)
  - [ ] `‚óã` Gray: Offline (no addresses reachable)
  - [ ] `‚óê` Yellow: Checking (currently trying)
  - [ ] `!` Red: Error (show error message)
- [ ] Update status as connection attempts progress
- [ ] Auto-refresh periodically (5 seconds)

### Integration Tests (2.4 Support)
- [ ] Test querying mock relay
- [ ] Test address try-order logic
- [ ] Test connection fallback
- [ ] Test status indicators
- [ ] Test error cases (no peers, timeout, etc.)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

## BLOCKERS & RISKS

### High Risk
- üî¥ **Mutual TLS in Node.js** - Ensure client cert extraction works
- üî¥ **Certificate format** - Must be compatible between Rust/Node/Browser
- üî¥ **IP detection** - Must work cross-platform (macOS/Linux/Windows)

### Medium Risk
- üü° **Expiration management** - TTL handling in database
- üü° **Network reachability** - Some addresses may not be reachable
- üü° **Browser CORS** - If browser needs to contact relay

### Low Risk
- üü¢ **Tauri event emission** - Standard Tauri feature
- üü¢ **React state management** - Standard React patterns
