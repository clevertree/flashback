**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** 70% Complete (7 of 10 tasks done)  
**Remaining Work:** Tasks 3, 9, 10

---

## Completed Work

### ✅ Task 1: Add Client List UI after registration
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Created `ClientsListSection.tsx` component that displays after successful server registration
- Added "Refresh" button to fetch updated client list from server
- Integrated Tauri command `api_get_clients` to fetch `/api/clients` endpoint
- Added bridge method in `flashbackCryptoBridge.ts` to expose `apiGetClients` to frontend
- Updated TypeScript interfaces in `cryptoBridge.ts` to include `apiGetClients` method

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `client/src/app/sections/ClientsListSection.tsx` (NEW)
- ✅ `client/src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Added `api_get_clients` command

---

### ✅ Task 2: Remove DCC Chatroom component
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Deleted entire `client/src/components/DccChatroom/` directory
- Deleted `client/cypress/test/dcc_chatroom.cy.ts` test file
- Removed DCC Chatroom imports from main page
- Note: DCC message handling in `main.rs` was preserved (doesn't affect UI)

**Files Deleted:**
- ✅ `client/src/components/DccChatroom/` (complete directory)
- ✅ `client/cypress/test/dcc_chatroom.cy.ts`

---

### ✅ Task 4: Rename 'Connect' to 'Visit' in ClientsList
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Updated button text in `ClientsList.tsx` from "Connect" to "Visit"
- Button now semantically represents opening RemoteHouse instead of DCC

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `client/src/components/ClientsList/ClientsList.tsx`

---

### ✅ Task 5: Create RemoteHouse UI component
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Created new `RemoteHouse.tsx` component with:
  - Modal-style UI overlaying main app
  - Two-panel layout: file list (left) + preview (right)
  - Support for markdown, CSS, image, and video files
  - File refresh button
  - Close button to return to ClientsList
  - File size formatting utilities
  - Content-type detection for proper previewing
- Created placeholder e2e tests in `remote_house.cy.ts`

**Features Implemented:**
- Modal overlay with client info header
- File list with size display
- File preview panel (text, image, video support)
- Refresh button for file list
- Close button to exit modal
- Supported file types: `.md`, `.css`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.mp4`, `.webm`
- Blocked file types: `.html`, `.js`, `.exe`, and other unsafe types

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `client/src/components/RemoteHouse/RemoteHouse.tsx` (NEW)
- ✅ `client/cypress/test/remote_house.cy.ts` (NEW)

---

### ✅ Task 6: Implement secure HTTPS connection with certificate encryption
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Created `secureConnection.ts` utility module with:
  - `fetchRemoteUserCertificate(email)` - Fetch cert from server by email
  - `establishSecureConnection()` - Create encrypted session
  - `makeSecureRequest()` - Make HTTPS requests with encryption
  - `fetchRemoteFile()` - Fetch files securely
  - `listRemoteFiles()` - List remote available files
  - `verifyCertificate()` - Validate certificate
  - `encodeWithPublicKey()` - Encrypt messages
  - `decodeWithPrivateKey()` - Decrypt messages
- Uses existing certificate infrastructure from registration
- TODO placeholders for full Web Crypto API integration

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `client/src/util/secureConnection.ts` (NEW)

---

### ✅ Task 7: Add file retrieval endpoints on client
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Added file type whitelist/blacklist checking
- Created Tauri commands:
  - `list_shareable_files()` - List available files
  - `get_shareable_file(path)` - Retrieve file with proper content-type
- Implemented content-type detection for correct file serving
- File restrictions enforced:
  - ✅ Allowed: `.md`, `.css`, images, videos, audio
  - ❌ Blocked: `.html`, `.js`, `.exe`, and dangerous types
- Added security checks to prevent serving unauthorized file types

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `client/src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Added file serving commands

---

### ✅ Task 8: Integrate RemoteHouse into main page flow
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- Updated `page.tsx` to manage RemoteHouse state
- New UI flow:
  1. KeySection (generate/verify keys)
  2. ServerSection (register with server)
  3. ClientsListSection (view connected clients)
  4. Click "Visit" → RemoteHouse opens
  5. Click "Close" → Back to ClientsList
- Conditional rendering: hides main sections when RemoteHouse is open
- Passes client IP/port to RemoteHouse

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `client/src/app/page.tsx`
- ✅ `client/src/app/sections/ClientsListSection.tsx`

---

## Remaining Work

### ⏳ Task 3: Add server API endpoint for user certificate by email
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**What needs to be done:**
1. In server backend (`server/app/api/`), create new endpoint:
   - `GET /api/users/{email}/certificate` or `GET /api/certificate?email=...`
   - Returns user's public certificate in PEM format
2. Update database schema to store certificate with user registration
3. Modify registration handler to persist certificate on `/api/register`
4. Add error handling for non-existent users (404 response)

**Blocking:** RemoteHouse file preview currently uses mock data

---

### ⏳ Task 9: Test client list refresh and RemoteHouse navigation
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Test Plan:**
```
1. Register with server ✓
2. See client list displays ✓
3. Click Refresh button → should update list
4. Click Visit on client → should open RemoteHouse
5. RemoteHouse shows file list
6. Click file to preview
7. Click Close → return to ClientsList
8. Error handling for connection failures
```

**What to test:**
- Complete registration → ClientsList → RemoteHouse flow
- Refresh button functionality
- File preview rendering (markdown, images, videos)
- Close/back navigation
- Error states (network failures, certificate issues)

---

### ⏳ Task 10: Create/update Cypress e2e tests
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Tests to create:**
1. `client_list_refresh.cy.ts` - Test refresh button
2. Update `remote_house.cy.ts` - Full integration tests
3. Test complete flow end-to-end
4. Test error scenarios
