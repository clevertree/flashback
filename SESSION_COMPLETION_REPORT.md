## Key Realizations

### 🔴 Critical Discovery
**Phase 2 was thought to be complete, but it's actually incomplete.**

**What was done:**
- ✅ Peer Server HTTP implementation
- ✅ RemoteHouse file browser UI
- ✅ 55+ E2E tests

**What was missing:**
- ❌ Relay Tracker backend (peer discovery)
- ❌ Client certificate generation
- ❌ Mutual TLS client setup
- ❌ Address list handling

**Impact:** Two users cannot find each other without Relay Tracker

### Timeline Correction
- **What we said:** "Phase 2 is complete"
- **What's actually true:** "Phase 2 core is done, Phase 2 discovery not started"
- **New estimate:** 4-5 weeks to complete Phase 2 (including discovery)

### Architecture Clarified
✅ Self-signed certificates with email embedded (CN)  
✅ Mutual TLS for Relay authentication  
✅ Address list for NAT traversal (try local IPs first)  
✅ Heartbeat keep-alive (every 30 minutes)  
✅ Direct P2P after Relay introduction  

---

## Gaps Resolved (10 Major → 0 Major)

| Gap | Resolution |
|-----|-----------|
| No authentication protocol documented | Mutual TLS specified with certificate model |
| Email spoofing possible | Certificates + email uniqueness + CN field |
| Localhost socket not reachable remotely | Listen on 0.0.0.0, use address list |
| Unclear how Relay gets peer socket | Broadcast/ready API provides port + addresses |
| NAT/network issues unaddressed | Address list ordering strategy (local first) |
| Relay implementation status unclear | Documented as Phase 2 prerequisite |
| Socket caching unclear | Address list stored by Relay, updated via heartbeat |
| Index.md behavior unclear | (Clarified doesn't need special handling) |
| Two connection pathways confused | Clear Relay → P2P flow established |
| Phase 2 completeness contradictory | Phase 2 complete only when discovery works end-to-end |

## Decisions Still Needed (3)

### 1. Is Relay Part of Phase 2?
- **Current:** Unclear
- **Recommendation:** YES - Relay is prerequisite for working discovery
- **Impact:** Changes timeline from "done" to "4-5 weeks"

### 2. Full Mutual TLS or Simpler?
- **Current:** Unclear
- **Recommendation:** Full mutual TLS (your protocol is solid)
- **Impact:** +2-3 days of complexity, excellent security

### 3. When to Start?
- **Current:** Not scheduled
- **Recommendation:** NOW - no blockers identified
- **Impact:** Can begin Phase 2A tomorrow if decided today
