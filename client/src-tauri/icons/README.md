# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the application icons.

When you have Rust and Tauri installed, you can generate proper icons using:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @tauri-apps/cli
npx tauri icon path/to/your-icon.png
```

This will generate all the required icon sizes automatically.

For now, the app will use Tauri's default icons.
