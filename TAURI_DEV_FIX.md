# Tauri Dev Server - Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Icon File
**Problem:** `tauri:dev` was failing with error:
```
failed to read icon /Users/ari.asulin/dev/test/rust2/src-tauri/icons/icon.png: No such file or directory
```

**Solution:** Created a minimal 1x1 PNG icon file at `src-tauri/icons/icon.png`
- Generated using Python's struct and zlib modules
- Transparent pixel PNG format
- Minimal file size for dev purposes

### 2. Build Status
All systems now working:
- ✅ `npm run test` - 5 tests passing
- ✅ `npm run build` - Next.js production build successful  
- ✅ `npm run tauri:dev` - Tauri dev server starting successfully

## Current Build Output

### Next.js Dev Server
```
✓ Ready in 892ms
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Rust/Tauri Compilation
```
Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.56s
✓ Compiled / in 1318ms (517 modules)
```

## Warnings (Non-blocking)

The following Rust warnings appear but don't prevent compilation:
- Unused imports in fabric-core and fabric.rs
- Unused variables (cert_pem, ca_cert_pem, etc.)
- Workspace profile configuration note

These can be fixed in a follow-up by prefixing unused variables with `_` but are not blocking development.

## Files Changed

- Created: `src-tauri/icons/icon.png`

## Git Commit

- **d0935be** - fix: add placeholder app icon for Tauri dev build

## Next Steps

The Tauri dev server is now ready for development:
- Frontend hot-reloads on code changes
- Rust code watches for changes
- Component folder structure is in place with isolated tests
- All build systems verified working
